    "### What is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a system for executing dynamic computational graphs over Tensor objects that behave similarly as numpy ndarray. It comes with a powerful automatic differentiation engine that removes the need for manual back-propagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. When using a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow you can harness the power of the GPU for your own custom neural network architectures without having to write CUDA code directly (which is beyond the scope of this class).\n",
    "* We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. \n",
    "* We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) \n",
    "* We want you to be exposed to the sort of deep learning code you might run into in academia or industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch versions\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you are using **PyTorch version >=1.0**. In some of the previous versions (e.g. before 0.4), Tensors had to be wrapped in Variable objects to be used in autograd; however Variables have now been deprecated. In addition 1.0 also separates a Tensor's datatype from its device, and uses numpy-style factories for constructing Tensors rather than directly invoking Tensor constructors.\n",

    "### PyTorch Tensors: Flatten Function\n",
    "A PyTorch Tensor is conceptionally similar to a numpy array: it is an n-dimensional grid of numbers, and like numpy PyTorch provides many functions to efficiently operate on Tensors. As a simple example, we provide a `flatten` function below which reshapes image data for use in a fully-connected neural network.\n",

    "\n",
    "* N is the number of datapoints\n",
    "* C is the number of channels\n",
    "* H is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n",
    "* W is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

    "# Part V. Resnet10 Implementation (35% of Grade)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will use the tools introduced above to implement the Resnet architecture. The Resnet architecture was introduced in: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf and it has become one of the most popular architectures used for computer vision. The key feature of the resnet architecture is the presence of skip connections which allow for better gradient flow even for very deep networks. Therefore, unlike vanilla CNNs introduced above, we can effectively build Resnets models having more than 100 layers. However, for the purposes of this exercise we will be using a smaller Resnet-10 architecture shown in the diagram below:![Screen%20Shot%202022-04-16%20at%207.51.18%20PM.png](attachment:Screen%20Shot%202022-04-16%20at%207.51.18%20PM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the architecture above, the downsampling is performed in conv5_1. We recommend using the adam optimzer for training Resnet. You should see about *45%* accuracy in 10 epochs. The template below is based on the Module API but you are allowed to use other Pytorch APIs if you prefer."

    "In this section, you can experiment with whatever ConvNet architecture you'd like on CIFAR-100 **except Resnet** because we already tried it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's your job to experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizers to train a model that achieves **at least 48%** accuracy on the CIFAR-100 **validation** set within 10 epochs. You can use the check_accuracy and train functions from above. You can use either `nn.Module` or `nn.Sequential` API. \n",

    "### Things you might try:\n",
    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5; would smaller filters be more efficient?\n",
    "- **Adam Optimizer**: Above we used SGD optimizer, would an Adam optimizer do better?\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",
    "- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster? You can also try out LayerNorm and GroupNorm.\n",
    "- **Network architecture**: Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for training\n",
    "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Want more improvements?\n",
    "There are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
